This documents my notes and codes while playing around with the experiments in the Ruby under a Microscope Book by [Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)

## Prerequisites

To run the experiments locally, you're going to need:

  - Linux or OS X â€” Windows may work, but I'm running on OS X
  - Ruby, I'm running version  `2.3.1`
